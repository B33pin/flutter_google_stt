# Streaming Speech Recognition Implementation Plan

## Current Issues with REST API Approach

1. **Chunked Processing**: 2-second audio chunks create artificial breaks
2. **High Latency**: Processing delay between chunks affects real-time feel
3. **No Interim Results**: Users only see final results, not progressive transcription
4. **Poor Continuity**: Even with overlap buffer and deduplication, flow is choppy
5. **Bandwidth Inefficient**: Sending Base64 encoded audio chunks is wasteful

## Solution: Google Cloud Speech Streaming API

### Key Benefits
- **Real-time streaming**: Continuous audio stream with immediate transcription
- **Interim results**: See transcription as you speak
- **Lower latency**: Sub-second response times
- **Better accuracy**: Context-aware processing across entire conversation
- **Natural flow**: No artificial breaks or chunks

### Implementation Strategy

#### Option 1: WebSocket Streaming (Recommended)
- Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Streaming API via WebSocket
- Send continuous audio stream
- Receive real-time interim and final results
- Much lower latency and better user experience

#### Option 2: gRPC Streaming 
- Native gRPC streaming for optimal performance
- Bidirectional streaming for audio upload and results
- Most efficient but more complex to implement

#### Option 3: Enhanced Chunking with Streaming API
- Keep current architecture but use streaming endpoint
- Smaller chunks (0.5s) with streaming recognition
- Interim results within chunks

## Recommended Implementation: WebSocket Streaming

### Architecture Changes Required

1. **Replace REST calls** with WebSocket connection
2. **Continuous audio streaming** instead of chunked processing
3. **Real-time result handling** for interim and final transcripts
4. **Connection management** for reconnection and error handling
5. **Audio buffering optimization** for smooth streaming

### Technical Requirements

- **Android**: OkHttp WebSocket client
- **iOS**: URLSessionWebSocketTask or native WebSocket
- **Audio streaming**: Continuous PCM audio stream
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with streaming scope
- **Error handling**: Reconnection logic for network issues

## Next Steps

1. Implement WebSocket streaming client for both platforms
2. Replace chunked audio processing with continuous streaming
3. Add interim result handling for real-time feedback
4. Optimize audio buffering for streaming
5. Add connection management and error recovery

This will provide a much more natural, continuous speech recognition experience that users expect from modern speech-to-text applications.
